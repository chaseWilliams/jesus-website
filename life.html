        <p>In a General Conference talk, Elder Weatherford T. Clayton outlines the three pillars to our Father’s Plan of Happiness: first, the Creation of the earth, second, the Fall of Adam and Eve, and third, Christ and the Atonement. We know that Christ was directed by Heavenly Father in creating the world we live in today. </p>
        <blockquote>Behold, I am Jesus Christ the Son of God. I created the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are. I was with the Father from the beginning. I am in the Father, and the Father in me; and in me hath the Father glorified his name.<cite>3 Nephi 9:15</cite></blockquote>
        <p>But more importantly, it is critical to understand that as a consequence of receiving moral agency, it was necessary that the Atonement be provided for us in order to provide a path where we could return to live with our Father in Heaven. 
        </p>
        <blockquote>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.<cite>John 3:16</cite></blockquote>
        <p>Due to human nature, attaining the ultimate goal of eternal life would be impossible. Thus, in the grand premortal council, it was foreordained that Jesus would suffer for our sins that we may have a chance at salvation. 
        </p>
        <p>The key to the Atonement is that Christ has literally suffered at the hands of anything and everything that ails us. The Savior’s empathy and understanding allows us to walk with Him and repent for our sins. To do this, Jesus needed to live as we do on earth, with an imperfect body and having passed through the Veil. </p>
        <blockquote>Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.<cite>Isaiah 7:14</cite></blockquote>
        <p>Mary, being a virgin, was conceived by the Holy Ghost, and Joseph, her fiance, was visited by an angel and told to name him Jesus, “for he shall save his people from their sins” (Matthew 1:21)</p>
        <p>His birth was celebrated by angels and heavenly signs, but ultimately the Savior lived a humble life. Joseph was a carpenter in Nazareth, and Jesus would follow in his shoes.</p>
        <p>The majority of the scriptures concerning Jesus’ time on the earth focus on his mortal ministry; thus, there is not much record of his life before he formally set out to teach and minister unto others. That is, except when at age 12, Jesus was separated from his family and found in the temple of Jerusalem teaching even the most learned of the city. When questioned, he asked his parents,
        </p>
        <blockquote>How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father’s business?<cite>Luke 2:49</cite></blockquote>
        <p>Jesus was 30 when he began his formal ministry. He traveled from Galilee to the Jordan River, where he would be baptized by John the Baptist. Jesus was without sin, but he still desired to be baptized in order to illustrate the importance of obedience to the Father in all things. Afterwards, the voice of God the Father declared,
        </p>
        <blockquote>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased<cite>Matthrew 3:17</cite></blockquote>
        <p>He would then go to the wilderness for 40 days and fast, and then was tempted by Satan three times, refusing every time. Finally, he would return to Galilee, where he chose several disciples and began performing miracles, with the first recorded miracle being the wedding where he turned water into wine. As he traveled through the land, Jesus would perform all manners of miracles: strengthening the lame, healing the sick, restoring vision to the blind, raising the dead, walking on water, etc. He also used parables, sermons, and other discourses to teach doctrine to his followers. My favorite is the story of the adulterer, where the Pharisees bring to Jesus a woman caught in adultery, asking him “Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?” Jesus would eventually reply,
        </p>
        <blockquote>He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her<cite>John 8:7</cite></blockquote>
        <p>The Pharisees and Sadducees were powerful religious leaders at the time, and Jesus often butted heads with them. They seeked to discredit him, to disway him, to imprison him. 
        </p>
        <p>Towards the end of his life, Jesus took three of His disciples upon a high mountain to pray. There the prophets Elijah and Moses appeared, and God proclaimed,</p>
        <blockquote>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear ye him<cite>Matthrew 17:5</cite></blockquote>
        <p>After that event, which is known now as the Transfiguration, Jesus would arrive in Jerusalem and be greeted with a reverent throng of people, which antagonized the priests and Pharisees. They drew up plans to arrest Jesus and involved Judas, one of His disciples. 
        </p>
        <p>A little later, at a Passover meal now known as the Last Supper, Jesus gathered his disciples and gave them some last words of faith and wisdom, as well as administering unto them the first sacrament.
        </p>
        <blockquote>And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me<cite>Luke 22:19</cite></blockquote>
        <p>Later, Jesus went to the Garden of Gethsemane to pray. Here he suffered for all of mankind’s sins, bleeding from every pore and bearing the weight of all our pain, anguish, and guilt. Judas later arrived, followed by soldiers and officials, and they promptly arrested Jesus. The Roman governor, giving in to the wish of the people for bloodshed, ordered Jesus to be crucified. Roman Soldiers carried Jesus to Calvary and nailed him to a cross. Despite the taunts of the crowd and the wrongdoings carried against Him, Jesus asked God,</p>
        <blockquote>Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do<cite>Luke 23:34</cite></blockquote>
        <p>After Jesus died, His body was buried in a nearby tomb. Three days later, the tomb was found empty, and Christ was resurrected. He first appeared to Mary Magdalene, and proceeded to show himself to other women, and then His disciples, where he would invite them to feel his wounds and command them to go forth and teach the gospel. After 40 days, he took His disciples to the Mount of Olives, where he spoke his final words to them. 
        </p>
        <blockquote>when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight<cite>Acts 1:9</cite></blockquote>
        <p>His post-resurrection ministry was not limited to the Holy Land. He had told His disciples,
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd<cite>John 10:16</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p>He appeared in the Americas, where his performed ordinances and miracles, and chose twelve disciples to similarly go forth and teach the gospel.</p>
        <p>To this day he continues to minister to us with the power of the Atonement. While his earthly ministry only lasted for a few decades, the consequences of it hold powerful ramifications for us, and we can learn much from His example and teachings in these latter days. </p>
