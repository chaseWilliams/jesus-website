        <p>Jesus Christ lived a perfect life here on earth, and thus He is the ultimate role model for us to model ourselves after. To fulfill your capacity as His disciple, you only need to look to the sacrament prayer.</p>
        <blockquote>O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this bread to the souls of all those who partake of it, that they may eat in remembrance of the body of thy Son, and witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they are willing to take upon them the name of thy Son, and always remember him and keep his commandments which he has given them; that they may always have his Spirit to be with them. Amen.</blockquote>
        <p>In this prayer, we affirm to three things for our covenant with God after being baptized: to take upon us the name of Christ, to always remember him, and to keep his commandments. If we do those three things, then we will feel the constant presence of his Spirit. </p>
        <p>Taking the name of Christ is a much more consequential act then simply calling yourself a Christian. It means that everywhere you go, at any time of the day, you are representing Him here on earth. Just as He is an example to us, so too does being a Christian mean being an example for others. Quite simply, taking the name of Christ means asking yourself, “What would Jesus do?”</p>
        <blockquote>… he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.<br/>
            “… I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.<br/>
            “And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.<br/>
            “I and my Father are one. <cite>John 7:15, 16, 18; John 8:26, 28, 29; John 10:30</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Jesus perfectly aligns his will with that of the Father. Just as he credits the Father in all his doings and does “those things that please him”, we too must seek to take to heart God’s wishes and never forget how we got to where we are. With God, we can attain the ultimate gift of eternal life. Without God, we are nothing. </p>
        <blockquote>Count your many blessings; name them one by one,<br/>
            And it will surprise you what the Lord has done.<cite>Count Your Blessings</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p>By remaining humble, we can always remember our Savior. Learning to lean on him is not a chore, but rather an act that’ll repay us in infinite blessings. </p>
        <blockquote>
            Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.<br/>
            “Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.<br/>
            “For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. <cite>Matthew 11:28-30</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Following God’s commandments is a must for strengthening our personal testimonies. While it may come easy to most to avoid temptations to murder, or commit adultery, or to love our earthly parents, the Lord requires that we obey all his commandments. </p>
        <blockquote>
            As we live the gospel, we progress in our understanding of obedience. At times we may be tempted to practice what I call “natural man’s obedience,” in which we disobediently reject God’s law in favor of our wisdom or our desires or even popularity. Because this is widely practiced by so many, this perversion of obedience diminishes God’s standards in our culture and in our laws.
            <br/><br/>
            At times members may participate in “selective obedience,” claiming to love God and honor God while picking and choosing which of His commandments and teachings—and the teachings and counsel of His prophets—they will fully follow.
            <br/><br/>
            Some obey selectively because they cannot perceive all the reasons for a commandment, just as children do not always understand the reasons for their parents’ counsel and rules. But we always know the reason we follow the prophets, for this is the Church of Jesus Christ, and it is the Savior who directs His prophets in all dispensations.
            <br/><br/>
            As our understanding of obedience deepens, we recognize the essential role of agency. When Jesus was in the Garden of Gethsemane, He prayed three times to His Father in Heaven, “O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.”8 God would not override the Savior’s agency, yet He mercifully sent an angel to strengthen His Beloved Son.”
            <cite>Elder Robert D. Hales, General Conference 2014</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Simon Peter is an excellent example of serving as a disciple of Christ. Peter had a deep love for the Savior, and made sure to always stand by his side. When Christ would eventually leave and command the apostles to go forth and spread the gospel, Peter would take that commandment to heart. He recognized himself as a “a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ” (2 Peter 1:1). He performed consistent and frequent missionary work in leading the church after Christ left. He didn’t shy away from persecution or imprisonment. When his death was at hand and he was to be crucified, he asked to be head downwards, as he saw himself unworthy to die in the same manner as Christ. 
            </p>
        <p>Being a disciple of Christ doesn’t mean that someone attends church weekly, or pays their tithing in full, or frequently posts scripture verses on social media. It runs deeper than that; it means a burning desire to get to know the Lord better, to serve Him in all ways possible, to love him with all our heart. Following in his footsteps will shape us better than any other tool, and allow us to return to live with our Father in Heaven one day.</p>
